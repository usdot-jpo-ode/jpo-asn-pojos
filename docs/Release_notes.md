# jpo-asn-pojos Release Notes

## Version 2.0.0, Java 25 compatibility

This release requires JDK 25 or newer for consumers of the `jpo-asn-runtime` and
`jpo-asn-j2735-2024` libraries. The Maven and Gradle library versions were incremented to
2.0.0 because Java 25 class files are not compatible with Java 21 runtimes.

The build also updates Lombok annotation processing, JaCoCo, Gradle, and the repository CI
toolchain for Java 25.

## Version 1.2.0, April 2026

This release adds support for client applications in restricted environments that are unable to
retrieve the JSON schemas from GitHub over the internet, by embedding the schemas in the resources
of the `jpo-asn-j2735-2024` library JAR.  Clients with no internet access, or with restricted
access, such as IPv6 only access, may retrieve them as resources from the JAR.

Includes one new feature:

* [JSON schemas in resources](https://github.com/neaeraconsulting/jpo-asn-pojos/pull/1)
* [Add SonarCloud analysis to CI workflow](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-asn-pojos/pull/18)

## Version 1.1.0, released October 2025

This release introduces JSON schema generation for J2735 messages based on POJO definitions and adds a distributionManagement tag to the repository pom.xml, enabling the jpo-ode to publish Maven packages that depend on the jpo-asn-pojos projects. A workaround has been implemented for a Jackson bug present in versions prior to 2.17.2, where the XmlReadContext nesting depth property was not incremented correctly during JSON deserialization. Additionally, this update resolves two serialization bugs caused by bitstrings with fewer named bits than the declared size and open types containing strings with special characters (e.g., &, <).

## Version 1.0.0, released May 2025

This is the initial release of this project.  It introduces a complete set of Java classes to be used for serializing and deserializing standard XER and JER encoded ASN.1 for the SAE J2735/2024 specification, with a comprehensive set of unit tests, and a command line tool for generating example messages.
