# Examples

This folder contains miscellaneous example of UPER binary, JER, and XER messages.  

Note that some of the textual (JER and XER) files are minified, and some of them are pretty-printed for human readability.  Some of the files are used in the unit tests for the POJOs.  It was a goal in developing the POJOs that they should be able to robustly deserialize JER and XER regardless formatting and whitespace, so the unit tests have examples of both minified and pretty-printed files.
