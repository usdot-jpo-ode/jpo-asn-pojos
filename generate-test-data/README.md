# Generating test data for J2735/2024

In testing the new standard it is useful to be able to create examples of all the features of all the message type.  The currently available hardware that is deployed in the field produces a subset of message with a subset of features from previous standards, so it is essential to be able to create samples of new message types and new features for testing. There are 2 preexisting third-party open-source tools for converting ASN.1 messages between formats and for generating message examples that have been found useful for this purpose:

* Converters generated using the [asn1c compiler](https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/usdot-asn1c) - Capable of generating UPER, XER, and JER.
* A converter generated using the [Erlang asn1ct compiler](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/asn1/asn1ct.html) - Capable of generating UPER and JER examples.

Also included in this repository is a new Java tool, developed during the process of creating and testing the POJOs, for generating XER and JER test messages:
* [jpo-asn-test-generator](../jpo-asn-test-generator/README.md)


## Java Converter

See the documentation for the test generator included in this project:
[jpo-asn-test-generator](../jpo-asn-test-generator/README.md)

Note that all examples generated from it should be verified to be valid by round tripping them
through an independent asn1 tool, such as the asn1c converter.

For example generate a random Road Weather Message:

```bash
java -jar testgen-cli.jar -m RoadWeatherMessage -p RoadWeatherMessage -x rwm.xml -j rwm.json
```

Then verify that the XML is valid using the asn1c converter.  Convert the XER to UPER:
```bash
./converter-debug -p RoadWeatherMessage -ixer -ouper rwm.xml > rwm.bin
```

Convert the UPER back to XER:
```bash
./converter-debug -p RoadWeatherMessage -iuper -oxer rwm.bin > rwm_rt.xml
```

And check that the files rwm.xml and rwm_rt.xml contain the same XML.

## asn1c Converters

This directory contains several converters created with the [VLM asn1c](https://github.com/vlm/asn1c)
compiler (using the [usdot fork](https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/usdot-asn1c) and
[mouse07410 fork](https://github.com/mouse07410/asn1c)). These are command line tools that work in
WSL/Ubuntu.

### converter-junktest

A converter generated generated with the `vlm_master` branch of the usdot fork [usdot fork](https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/usdot-asn1c) of asn1c.

Compiled with the "JUNKTEST" flag that allows generating random data.  
Uses the `asn_random_fill` api function. It was compiled with the -no-gen-JER and -no-gen-UPER,
-no-gen-APER,
because it wouldn't compile with JER, and following the recommendation in the asn1c
`asn1c-usage.pdf`which says:
> For best results the code should be generated without -no-gen-PER option to asn1c.
> Making PER constraints code available in runtime will make asn_random_fill explore
> the edges of PER-visible constraints and sometimes break out of extensible contstraintsâ€™
> ranges

This converter generates BASIC XER. For message frames that contain octet strings, the hex strings
need to have
spaces removed to be consistent with Canonical XER which the ODE and asn1jvm runtime expect.

This tool tends to generate a lot of very random junk, especially for large messages that contain
character string, octet string, or bitstring types. It does not respect the size constraint of
bitstrings.
It often fails with large messages, but often will generate something if you keep trying.

#### Usage Examples

To list all available messages:

```bash
./converter-junktest -p list
```

To generate an example of the new BSM Part III extension:

```bash
./converter-junktest -p TravelerDataFrameNewPartIIIContent -R 1024 > TravelerDataFrameNewPartIIIContent-1.xml
```

To generate a SensorDataSharingMessage (this segfaults about half the time):

```bash
./converter-junktest -p SensorDataSharingMessage -R 2048 > sdsm1.xml
```

### converter-debug

The generated converter example compiled with the `vlm_master` branch of the usdot fork [usdot fork](https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/usdot-asn1c).

Compiled with verbose debug output enabled, and CANONICAL XML support.

Can be used to convert between UPER, CANONICAL XER, and JER, and to diagnose issues where the asn1c
converters are unable to process a message.

This converter consumes and produces **CANONICAL** XER which is the same dialect of XER that the ODE
and asn1jvm POJOs expect. It is characterized by octet strings with no spaces between the bytes,
and compact XML with no line breaks or indentation.

Example. To convert the above SDSM XER to JER:

```bash
./converter-debug -p SensorDataSharingMessage -ixer -ojer sdsm1.xml > sdsm1.json
```

Another example to convert a BSM MessageFrame from a file containing UPER-encoded binary to XER and
JER:

```bash
./converter-debug -p MessageFrame -iuper -oxer bsm_mf_noext_01.bin > bsm_mf.xml
./converter-debug -p MessageFrame -iuper -ojer bsm_mf_noext_01.bin > bsm_mf.json
```

### converter-new-jer

A converter generated from the `vlm_master` branch of the [mouse07410 fork](https://github.com/mouse07410/asn1c) of asn1c, which contains updates to the JER implementation that aren't present in the USDOT fork.  Specifically, it contains changes to the implementation of variable length bitstring encodings in JER.

Produces and accepts Canonical XER and Minified JER.

### roundtrip.sh script

This script can be used to pass XER and JER messages generated by the Java test generator through the asn1c codec to verify their compatibility and correctness.

## Erlang converter

See:

https://github.com/iyourshaw/j2735-erlang

The Erlang converter's random asn.1 generator has it's own quirks, the main one being that
if messages contain open types, it fills them with random junk that needs to be removed
to get a valid message. It is capable of producing UPER and JER, but not XER.
It respects bitstring sizes, and is better able to generate large messages than asn1c.

It can be run using the dev container in that repo.

Example, generate a random RoadSafetyMessage and save to a file:

```erlang
% Create a random message
{ok, Rsm} = asn1ct:value('RoadSafetyMessage', 'RoadSafetyMessage').

% Save the Erlang term to a file
file:write_file("../examples/rsm.src", io_lib:format("~p.~n", [Rsm])).
```

Manually edit, replacing the Regional Extension open types like:

```erlang
[{'RegionalExtension',107,<<"\n\topen_type">>},
{'RegionalExtension',71,<<"\n\topen_type">>},
{'RegionalExtension',41,<<"\n\topen_type">>}]
```

with `asn1_NOVALUE`

Reload the edited erlang term and convert to UPER and JER and save to a file:

```erlang
% Reload the Erlang term
{ok, [RsmReload]} = file:consult("../examples/rsm.src").

% Convert to UPER
{ok, RsmUper} = 'RoadSafetyMessage':encode('RoadSafetyMessage', RsmReload).

% Save UPER to file
file:write_file("rsm.bin", RsmUper).

% Convert to JER
{ok, RsmJer} = 'RoadSafetyMessage':jer_encode('RoadSafetyMessage', RsmReload).

% Save JER to file
file:write_file("rsm.json", RsmJer).
```
