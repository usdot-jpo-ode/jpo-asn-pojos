# Generating test data for J2735/2024

We have 2 tools for generating message examples:

* asn1c converters
* Erlang converters

## asn1c Converters
This directory contains two converters created with VLM asn1c.  
These are command line tools that work in WSL/Ubuntu.

These generate BASIC XER.  For message frames that contain octet string, the hex strings need to have
spaces removed to be consistent with Canonical XER which the asn1jvm runtime expects.

### converter-junktest 
Compiled with the "JUNKTEST" flag that allows generating random data.  
Uses the `asn_random_fill` api function. It was compiled with the -no-gen-JER and -no-gen-UPER, -no-gen-APER,
because it wouldn't compile with JER, and following the recommendation in the asn1c `asn1c-usage.pdf`which says: 
>For best results the code should be generated without -no-gen-PER option to asn1c.
Making PER constraints code available in runtime will make asn_random_fill explore
the edges of PER-visible constraints and sometimes break out of extensible contstraintsâ€™
ranges

This tool tends to generate a lot of very random junk, especially for large messages that contain
character string, octet string, or bitstring types.  It does not respect the size constraint of bitstrings.
It often fails with large messages, but often will generate something if you keep trying.

#### Usage Examples

To list all available messages:

```bash
./converter-junktest -p list
```

To generate an example of the new BSM Part III extension:

```bash
./converter-junktest -p TravelerDataFrameNewPartIIIContent -R 1024 > TravelerDataFrameNewPartIIIContent-1.xml
```
To generate a SensorDataSharingMessage (this segfaults about half the time):

```bash
./converter-junktest -p SensorDataSharingMessage -R 2048 > sdsm1.xml
```

### converter-all
Compiled with all encodings.  This can be used to convert XER to JER.

Example. To convert the above SDSM XER to JER:

```bash
./converter-all -p SensorDataSharingMessage -ixer -ojer sdsm1.xml > sdsm1.json
```

## Erlang converter

See:

https://github.com/iyourshaw/j2735-erlang

The Erlang converter's random asn.1 generator has it's own quirks, the main one being that
if messages contain open types, it fills them with random junk that needs to be removed
to get a valid message. It is capable of producing JER, but not XER.
But on the positive side, it respects bitstring sizes, and is better able
to generate large messages than asn1c.

It can be run using the dev container in that repo.

Example, generate a random RoadSafetyMessage and save to a file:

```erlang
{ok, Rsm} = asn1ct:value('RoadSafetyMessage', 'RoadSafetyMessage').
file:write_file("../examples/rsm.src", io_lib:format("~p.~n", [Rsm])).
```

Manually edit, replacing the Regional Extension open types like:
```erlang
[{'RegionalExtension',107,<<"\n\topen_type">>},
{'RegionalExtension',71,<<"\n\topen_type">>},
{'RegionalExtension',41,<<"\n\topen_type">>}]
```
with `asn1_NOVALUE`

Reload the edited erlang term and convert to JER and save to a file:

```erlang
{ok, [RsmReload]} = file:consult("../examples/rsm.src").
{ok, RsmJer} = 'RoadSafetyMessage':jer_encode('RoadSafetyMessage', RsmReload).
file:write_file("rsm.json", RsmJer).
```
